Hello! I am currently an undergraduate student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, majoring in Artificial Intelligence: Systems & Technologies. My research interests lie in the application of artificial intelligence across various domains, including robotic perception, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

I am currently gaining valuable experience as a research intern at the Robotics, Embodied AI, and Navigation In Vivo Lab, under the supervision of Prof. Hongliang Ren. In addition, I am also interning at SenseTime.
